# This is the 3rd exercise!
# This is to demonstrate maths within Python.

# This will print out the line "I will now count my chickens:"
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# These 2 lines will print out their lines and the result of the maths used.
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# This will print out the line "Now I will count the eggs:"
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# This prints out the value of this calculation...
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# Just prints out the line in here.
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# This prints out true.
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# These 2 lines prints out the strings and the result of the maths.
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

# Just prints out another line.
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Just prints out another line.
print "How about some more."

# This prints out True or False for these... go Boolean!
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
